\title{Finds timeseries of NARR data nearest to specified location}
\usage{
NARRgetNearestTimeseries(
  ncdfFile,
  varName,
  pointLon,
  pointLat,
  timezone = "",
  quiet = TRUE,
  logfile = ""
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ncdfFile}{Name of the NetCDF file containing ERA data.}

\item{varName}{Required. Name of the NetCDF variable to extract.}

\item{pointLon}{Required. Decimal longitude of desired location. Note that the NetCDF longitude is \emph{East}, your value should be negative.}

\item{pointLat}{Required. Decimal latitude of desired location.}

\item{timezone}{Required. The name of the timezone of the data as a character string. This should be the timezone of your data, but omitting daylight savings time. Note that the timezone code is specific to your OS. To avoid problems, you should use a timezone without daylight savings time. Under Linux, you can use \option{CST} and \option{MST} for Central Standard or Mountain Standard time, respectively. Under Windows or OSX, you can use \option{etc/GMT+6} or \option{etc/GMT+7} for Central Standard and Mountain Standard time. DO NOT use \option{America/Regina} as the time zone, as it includes historical changes between standard and daylight savings time.}

\item{quiet}{Optional. Suppresses display of messages, except for errors. If you are calling this function in an R script, you will usually leave \code{quiet=TRUE} (i.e. the default). If you are working interactively, you will probably want to set \code{quiet=FALSE}, as it will list the actual latitude and longitude of the ERA tile.}

\item{logfile}{Optional. Name of the file to be used for logging the action. Normally not used.}
}
\value{
If unsuccessful, returns \code{FALSE}. If successful, returns a standard \pkg{CRHMr} dataframe containing the datetime and the extracted data, which are unpacked (i.e. the NetCDF multiplier and offset have been applied). If \code{quiet=FALSE}, then the NARR location used and its distance to the specified location will be displayed.

If unsuccessful, returns \code{FALSE}. If successful, returns a \pkg{CRHMr} data frame of the specified variable. Note that no unit conversions are done, so the variable will be in the NARR units.
}
\description{
Reads a NARR NetCDF file, which contains all of the 3-hour values of a single variable for a single year, and extracts the values for a single location. Note that the values are \emph{NOT} quality controlled - negative precipitation values are possible.

p1979 <- NARRgetNearestTimeseries('acpcp.1979.nc', varName='acpcp', pointLon = -113,
