\title{Creates a CRHM .obs file of 3-hourly and 6-hourly values from WATCH reanalysis data WFD files}
\usage{
WATCHcreateWFDobs(
  nc.location = "",
  startyear = 1901,
  endyear = 2001,
  lon = 0,
  lat = 0,
  houroffset = 0,
  obsFileName = "",
  quiet = TRUE,
  logfile = ""
)
}
\arguments{
\item{nc.location}{Required. A character string of the directory holding the WATCH WFD netCDf files. This is a file path WITHOUT a terminal slash, e.g. \option{z:\\WATCH\\WFD}.}

\item{startyear}{Optional. Year to begin. Must be in the range \code{1901-2001}. Default is \code{1901}.}

\item{endyear}{Optional. Year to end. Must be in the range \code{1901-2001}. Default is \code{2001}.}

\item{lon}{Required. Decimal longitude to extract for.}

\item{lat}{Required. Decimal latitude to extract for.}

\item{houroffset}{Required. Number of hours that the local location is offset from UTC (GMT). Must be negative in the western hemisphere. For Mountain Standard Time, the offset is \code{-7} hours.}

\item{obsFileName}{Required. Name of the .obs file to be created.}

\item{quiet}{Optional. Suppresses display of messages, except for errors. If you are calling this function in an R script, you will usually leave \code{quiet=TRUE} (i.e. the default). If you are working interactively, you will probably want to set \code{quiet=FALSE}.}

\item{logfile}{Optional. Name of the file to be used for logging the action. Normally not used.}
}
\value{
If successful, returns the value \code{TRUE} and writes the specified .obs file. Each month's data is written as it is created. If unsuccessful, returns the value \code{FALSE}.
}
\description{
Extracts data from WATCH WFD netCDF files and builds a CRHM .obs file of 3-hour data containing \code{t}, \code{ea}, \code{u10}, and \code{p} values. The values of \code{t}, \code{ea} and \code{u} are 6-hourly, with \code{NA} values inserted. The data are output at MST. The output values can be interpolated to hourly values using the function \code{HourlyWATCHObs}. The windspeeds are at 10m, so they are denoted as \code{u10}. Air temperatures are at 2m. The values for \code{ea} are computed from the atmospheric pressure (at 10m) and the absolute humidity (at 2m).
