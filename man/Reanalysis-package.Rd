\title{Contains functions to download and process reanalysis data}
\description{
The package contains functions to download and process reanalysis data. Functions are provided for ERA (-Interim and -40), NARR and WATCH datasets. Because there are so many functions and all of the datasets are slightly different, each function name includes the dataset as a prefix.
